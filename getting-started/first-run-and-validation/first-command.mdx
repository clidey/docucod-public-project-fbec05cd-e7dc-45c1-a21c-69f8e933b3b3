# Running Your First Command

This guide takes you through launching the `mycmd` CLI tool, exploring its built-in help and version commands, and running a sample command. You'll gain a clear understanding of the hierarchical command and command group structure that MyCmd uses. By the end, you'll see what a successful command execution looks like and be ready to run your own commands daily.

---

## 1. Launching MyCmd: Basic Usage

MyCmd is your launcher to execute Bash scripts organized in a directory hierarchy. Instead of running scripts directly, you invoke `mycmd` followed by the command groups and commands, with spaces separating hierarchy levels.

### 1.1 Displaying Help and Version Information

Start by exploring the built-in help and version outputs:

```shell
mycmd --help
mycmd -h
mycmd --version
mycmd -v
```

These commands show general usage instructions and the installed MyCmd version.

### 1.2 Getting Help for Command Groups and Commands

To view help for specific command groups or commands, append the groups and commands to the `mycmd` command, ending with `--help` or `-h`. For example:

```shell
mycmd create --help
mycmd logging --help
mycmd test-command-group test-command --help
```

This hierarchical help respects the structure of command groups and commands in your setup.


## 2. Understanding Command and Command Group Structure

MyCmd organizes scripts into a two-level hierarchy:

- **Command Groups**: Directories representing logical groupings of commands. Each has supporting shared code in a special library file named `<group_name>-lib`.

- **Commands**: Executable scripts within command group directories.

For example:

```text
mycmd/            # Top level (implicit command group)
  create/          # Command Group
    create-script  # Command script
  logging/         # Command Group
    log-setup      # Command script
```

You run a command by specifying its hierarchy separated by spaces, not slashes, like so:

```shell
mycmd create create-script
```

---

## 3. Running a Sample Command: `test-command-group test-command`

A practical way to verify your MyCmd environment is working is by running the included test command.

### 3.1 Step-by-Step Execution

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run the following command:

```shell
mycmd test-command-group test-command
```

3. Observe the output:

```text
Running test-command.
Finished execution of test-command.
```

This message confirms that MyCmd successfully located, loaded, and executed the test command script.

### 3.2 What Happens Under the Hood?

- MyCmd identifies the fully qualified command name `test-command-group/test-command`.
- It loads associated command group libraries and support code.
- It runs the main function of the command script.
- Deferred startup and exit messages demonstrate lifecycle event hooks.


## 4. Exploring Environment Variables Recognized by MyCmd

MyCmd recognizes several environment variables that affect its behavior. Here are the key variables you might set or observe:

| Variable               | Purpose                                                                            |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MYCMD_SYSTEM_BASE_DIR` | Directory for system-defined command groups.                                      |
| `MYCMD_USER_BASE_DIR`   | Directory for user-defined command groups. Defaults to `$HOME/mycmd`. Must exist. |
| `MYCMD_SEARCH_PATH`     | Colon-separated list of directories MyCmd searches for command groups and commands.|
| `MYCMD_SHELL_TRACE`     | Enables Bash xtrace (`set -x`) for command execution.                             |
| `MYCMD_SHELL_VERBOSE`   | Enables Bash verbose mode (`set -v`) during command execution.                     |
| `MYCMD_DEBUG`           | Enables debug logging during command execution.                                   |
| `MYCMD_TRACE`           | Enables trace logging during command execution.                                   |
| `MYCMD_LOG_FILE`        | Specifies a file where MyCmd logs output instead of standard error.               |

> These can be set to customize debug, trace, or logging behaviors as you develop or run commands.


## 5. Command and Command Group Help Output Example

To exemplify how MyCmd displays help for a command, use the test command group:

```shell
mycmd test-command-group test-command --help
```

Expected output:

```text
mycmd test-command-group test-command version 0.1

Test Command for MyCmd

Options:
  test-command-group test-command -h
```

This concise help message includes the command version, short description, and usage hints.


## 6. Best Practices for Running Your First Commands

- Always start by running `mycmd --help` to familiarize yourself with available commands.
- Use `--help` on specific command groups and commands to learn their options.
- Verify your environment variables like `MYCMD_USER_BASE_DIR` if commands are not found.
- Run the provided test command (`test-command-group test-command`) to confirm setup.
- Gradually explore more complex commands as you grow comfortable.


## 7. Troubleshooting Tips

If you encounter issues when running your first command:

- **Command not found errors:**
  - Verify your `MYCMD_USER_BASE_DIR` and `MYCMD_SEARCH_PATH` are set and directories exist.
  - Ensure that your PATH includes the directory containing `mycmd` executable.

- **Permission denied:**
  - Check that command scripts have execute permissions.

- **Unexpected output or failures:**
  - Enable debug or trace logging with `MYCMD_DEBUG=1` or `MYCMD_TRACE=1` to get detailed logs.

- **No output:**
  - Confirm that the command script exists in the expected location.
