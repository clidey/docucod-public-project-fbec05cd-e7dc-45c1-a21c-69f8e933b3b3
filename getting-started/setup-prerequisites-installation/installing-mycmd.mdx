# Installing MyCmd

This guide provides a clear, step-by-step walkthrough for installing **MyCmd** by cloning the repository and setting up your environment using the provided installation script. It covers both the Git-based and HTTPS-based installation methods, explains essential file path conventions, and highlights permissions and proper placement of files in your environment.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing MyCmd, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Linux, macOS, or any Unix-like OS where Bash 5.x or later and GNU core utilities can be installed.
- **Bash Version:** Bash 5.x is required.
- **GNU Utilities:** Coreutils, findutils, sed, and grep (GNU versions specifically).

### macOS Users

Install required GNU utilities via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) as follows:

```shell
brew install bash coreutils findutils gnu-sed grep
```

These dependencies are critical because MyCmd uses features and flags specific to GNU versions.

## 2. Installation Instructions

MyCmd is currently pre-release software and is installed only via Git checkout. The recommended method uses a helper script that sets up a Git worktree with a snapshot of a known good version.

### 2.1 Download the Setup Script

First, download the setup script and make it executable:

```shell
curl -sSL -O "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/travisbhartwell/mycmd/main/support/setup-dev-environment.sh"
chmod +x setup-dev-environment.sh
```

### 2.2 Choose Your Installation Method

There are two ways to clone the repository:

- **Git Protocol (SSH)** - requires an SSH GitHub account configured:

```shell
./setup-dev-environment.sh $HOME/Projects
```

- **HTTPS Protocol** - requires no Git account configuration but may ask for GitHub credentials for rate-limited requests:

```shell
MYCMD_USE_GIT_HTTPS=1 ./setup-dev-environment.sh $HOME/Projects
```

Replace `$HOME/Projects` with the parent directory where you want MyCmd installed.

### 2.3 What Happens Next?

- The script checks out MyCmd into a subdirectory named `mycmd` under the directory you specify (e.g., `$HOME/Projects/mycmd`).
- A snapshot of the latest known good state is created as `mycmd/snapshot`.

### 2.4 Important Directory Details

- Your user-written commands and command groups must **not** go into the installation directory directly.
- The directory `~/mycmd` is **reserved** for your personal command groups and commands.
- The repository clones and snapshots must remain outside of `~/mycmd` (or your user base directory) to avoid conflicts.

---

## 3. Environment Setup & Path Configuration

### 3.1 Update your PATH environment variable

To use the `mycmd` command globally, add the snapshot’s binary directory to your shell's `PATH`.

For example, if you installed MyCmd to `$HOME/Projects/mycmd`:

```shell
# Add to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, or ~/.zshrc depending on your shell
export PATH="$HOME/Projects/mycmd/snapshot/bin:$PATH"
```

After adding this line, reload your shell configuration or restart your terminal:

```shell
source ~/.bashrc  # or the appropriate profile file
```

### 3.2 Verification

Verify that `mycmd` is available:

```shell
which mycmd
# Expected output:
# /home/youruser/Projects/mycmd/snapshot/bin/mycmd

mycmd --version
# Should output MyCmd version and related info
```

### 3.3 Permissions

Make sure the setup script (`setup-dev-environment.sh`) and the cloned directories have correct executable permissions. The setup script should already be executable; the cloned files generally do not require manual permission changes.

## 4. Common Installation Pitfalls and Tips

- **Incorrect directory choice:** Do not use your home directory (`~`) as the parent directory in the setup script. Use a dedicated projects directory (e.g., `~/Projects`).
- **Missing GNU dependencies:** Especially on macOS, missing GNU core-utils will cause failures. Always install them with Homebrew.
- **PATH not updated:** If after installation `mycmd` is not found, ensure your shell `PATH` includes the snapshot bin directory.
- **Git access issues:** If using the Git protocol method, confirm your SSH keys are configured properly with GitHub.
- **Confusion around user directories:** Understand that `MYCMD_USER_BASE_DIR` defaults to `~/mycmd`. Do not install or clone MyCmd itself there.

## 7. Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation FAQs">
<Accordion title="Why does the setup script refuse my home directory?">
The directory `~/mycmd` is reserved for user command groups. Using your home directory as the checkout parent would conflict with this and cause unexpected behavior.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I install MyCmd without Git?">
Currently, MyCmd requires a Git checkout. The setup script supports using HTTPS to pull from GitHub if you don't have Git credentials configured, but Git is still required.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if I don’t have SSH keys for Git?">
Use the HTTPS installation method by setting the environment variable `MYCMD_USE_GIT_HTTPS=1` when running the setup script.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I update MyCmd after initial installation?">
Use Git commands inside the `mycmd` directory under your chosen projects folder to pull updates. For example, run `git pull` inside `$HOME/Projects/mycmd`.
