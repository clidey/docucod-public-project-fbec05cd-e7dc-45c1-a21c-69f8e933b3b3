# Setting Up Your Environment

This guide walks you through properly configuring your shell environment so that the `mycmd` command-line tool is accessible immediately after installation. Correctly setting your `PATH` environment variable ensures that your system can locate the `mycmd` executable, allowing you to run commands seamlessly.

---

## 1. Understanding the Installation Location

When you install MyCmd, the main executable binary `mycmd` is placed in a `bin` directory inside the MyCmd installation path. There are two core directories involved:

- **System Base Directory (`MYCMD_SYSTEM_BASE_DIR`)**: This is where the main MyCmd system files and binary reside. Typically, this will be the folder containing the `bin/` directory.
- **User Base Directory (`MYCMD_USER_BASE_DIR`)**: This directory often holds user-specific command groups and custom extensions.

The important takeaway is that the `bin` directory inside the System Base (`${MYCMD_SYSTEM_BASE_DIR}/bin`) must be included in your shell's `PATH`.

---

## 2. Adding MyCmd to Your PATH

### Step-by-Step for Bash or Zsh Shells

1. **Locate your shell configuration file**:
   - For **Bash**, this is usually `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`.
   - For **Zsh**, this is `~/.zshrc`.

2. **Open the file in your preferred text editor**:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
# or
nano ~/.zshrc
```

3. **Add the following line to set the path**:

```bash
export PATH="${MYCMD_SYSTEM_BASE_DIR}/bin:$PATH"
```

> Replace `${MYCMD_SYSTEM_BASE_DIR}` with the actual absolute path where MyCmd is installed, for example `/usr/local/mycmd`.

4. **Save and close the file**.

5. **Apply the changes by sourcing your shell config or restarting the terminal:**

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
# or
source ~/.zshrc
```

6. **Verify the path includes MyCmd:**

```bash
echo $PATH
```

The output should display your MyCmd bin directory near the front.

### Example

If you installed MyCmd to `/usr/local/mycmd`, add:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/mycmd/bin:$PATH"
```
to your shell config file.

---

## 3. Tips for Persistent and Correct Setup

- **Use Absolute Paths**: Always use the absolute path to your MyCmd installation in your `PATH` variable to avoid resolution issues.
- **Ordering Matters**: Placing MyCmd's `bin` directory at the front of your `PATH` ensures its commands override any similarly named ones elsewhere.
- **Avoid Duplicate Entries**: Check your `PATH` does not contain duplicate MyCmd paths to reduce confusion.
- **Use Environment Variables**: If you prefer, define and export the `MYCMD_SYSTEM_BASE_DIR` variable in your shell config, then extend `PATH` using it:

```bash
export MYCMD_SYSTEM_BASE_DIR="/usr/local/mycmd"
export PATH="$MYCMD_SYSTEM_BASE_DIR/bin:$PATH"
```

- **Validate Directory Existence**: Confirm the `bin` directory exists inside your MyCmd system base directory before updating your `PATH`.

---

## 4. Special Considerations

### macOS Users
If you installed MyCmd with Homebrew or in a custom location, ensure you use the Homebrew installation path for `MYCMD_SYSTEM_BASE_DIR`. For example, `/usr/local/opt/mycmd` or `/opt/homebrew/opt/mycmd`.

### Using Other Shells
For shells like Fish or Csh, the syntax to modify the `PATH` differs. Refer to your shell's documentation and ensure you add MyCmd's `bin` directory accordingly.

---

## 5. Verifying Your Environment Setup

Once configured:

1. Open a new terminal session or source your shell configuration.
2. Run:

```bash
which mycmd
```

This command should return the full path to the `mycmd` binary inside your installation's `bin` folder.

3. Test executing `mycmd`:

```bash
mycmd --version
```

You should see the version number printed, confirming MyCmd is properly accessible.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

- **`mycmd` command not found:**
  - Double-check the absolute path in your `PATH` variable.
  - Confirm the `bin/mycmd` file exists and is executable.
  - Ensure you restarted or sourced your shell configuration after editing.

- **Multiple versions or conflicts:**
  - Use `type -a mycmd` to list all locations of `mycmd` in your `PATH`.
  - Remove conflicting entries or reorder your `PATH` to prioritize the correct one.

- **Permission denied:**
  - Verify the `mycmd` binary has executable permissions:

```bash
ls -l ${MYCMD_SYSTEM_BASE_DIR}/bin/mycmd
chmod +x ${MYCMD_SYSTEM_BASE_DIR}/bin/mycmd
```

- **Environment variables not set:**
  - Make sure environment variables like `MYCMD_SYSTEM_BASE_DIR` (if used) are exported correctly.

## 7. Next Steps

With your environment properly set up:

- Begin by running your first commands with MyCmd (see [Running Your First Command](../first-run-and-validation/first-command)).
- Explore configuring MyCmd for your personal workflow ([Configuring MyCmd for Your Workflow](../configuration-troubleshooting/configuring-mycmd)).
- Refer to troubleshooting tips if you encounter any issues ([Troubleshooting Installation and First Run](../configuration-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-setup)).
