# Troubleshooting Installation and First Run

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve common setup and startup issues when installing and running MyCmd for the first time. It focuses on addressing missing dependencies, `PATH` misconfiguration, permission problems, and offers actionable diagnostics. Use this as your first stop if MyCmd does not start as expected.

---

## 1. Common Setup and Installation Issues

### 1.1 Missing Dependencies

MyCmd relies on GNU Bash (minimum version 4.0) and several essential GNU utilities such as `sed`, `find`, `realpath`, and others. If any of these are missing or inaccessible, MyCmd will fail to start or function correctly.

#### How to Diagnose

- Run the following diagnostic command to check if critical binaries are available:

```bash
for cmd in bash sed find realpath; do
    if ! command -v "$cmd" &>/dev/null; then
        echo "Missing dependency: $cmd"
    else
        echo "$cmd is available at: $(command -v $cmd)"
    fi
done
```

- Verify your Bash version with:

```bash
bash --version
```

It must be version 4.0 or later.

#### What to Do

- Install missing tools via your package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `brew`).
- On macOS, use Homebrew to install GNU utilities:

```bash
brew install gnu-sed coreutils findutils gnu-tar
```

- Ensure the installed tools are on your `PATH` and take precedence over system defaults.

### 1.2 `PATH` Environment Misconfiguration

If the directory containing the `mycmd` executable is not in your `PATH`, your shell won't be able to locate and run it.

#### How to Diagnose

- Check if `mycmd` is in your path:

```bash
command -v mycmd
```

If no path is returned, the `mycmd` binary is not discoverable.

- Print your `PATH` environment variable:

```bash
echo "$PATH"
```

Look for the directory where `mycmd` was installed.

#### What to Do

1. Locate your MyCmd installation bin directory. This is typically something like `/usr/local/bin` or `$HOME/mycmd/bin`.

2. Add this directory to your `PATH` in your shell profile:

For Bash (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`):

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/mycmd/bin"
```

3. Reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

or restart the terminal.

4. Verify again:

```bash
command -v mycmd
```

### 1.3 Permission Issues

If the `mycmd` binary or its related files are not executable or readable by your user, you will encounter errors launching the application.

#### How to Diagnose

- Check permissions:

```bash
ls -l /path/to/mycmd/bin/mycmd
```

- Ensure the binary has execute permission (`-rwxr-xr-x` or similar).

#### What to Do

- Update permissions if necessary:

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/mycmd/bin/mycmd
```

- If using MyCmd configs or user directories, verify you have read/write access.


## 2. Quick Diagnostic Commands

Run these commands to quickly assess your installation health and runtime environment:

```bash
# Check MyCmd version and basic help output (should print usage info)
mycmd --version
mycmd --help

# List available command groups
mycmd

# Run built-in test command to verify command execution
mycmd test-command
```

If any of these commands return errors or unexpected output, note the exact messages for troubleshooting.

## 3. Diagnosing Common Error Messages

| Error Symptom                         | Likely Cause                   | Diagnostic Commands                       | Resolution                       |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `command not found: mycmd`          | `mycmd` not in PATH            | `command -v mycmd`                       | Add `mycmd` bin to PATH         |
| `permission denied` when running    | Executable permission missing | `ls -l $(command -v mycmd)`               | Set executable permission       |
| `bash: mycmd: No such file or dir`  | Installation incomplete or wrong path | Check installation directory     | Reinstall or fix PATH           |
| Missing utility, e.g., `realpath` not found | Dependency not installed | `command -v realpath`                     | Install missing dependency      |

## 4. Actionable Tips and Best Practices

- Always confirm environment variables `MYCMD_SYSTEM_BASE_DIR` and `MYCMD_USER_BASE_DIR` are set correctly and directories exist.
- Avoid modifying core MyCmd binaries manually; use documented installation and upgrade paths.
- Use verbose or debug modes for detailed logs:

```bash
export MYCMD_DEBUG=1
mycmd <command>
```

- Consult MyCmd logs if available (`MYCMD_LOG_FILE` environment variable).

## 5. Troubleshooting Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Installation and PATH">
Run `command -v mycmd` and confirm the output shows the correct path. If not, adjust your PATH.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Dependencies">
Ensure required commands (`bash`, `sed`, `find`, `realpath`, etc.) exist by running `command -v` for each.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Permissions">
Check that `mycmd` binary is executable with `ls -l` and fix with `chmod +x` if needed.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Basic Command">
Try `mycmd --version` and `mycmd test-command` to validate basic functionality.
</Step>
<Step title="Enable Debug Mode">
Setup `MYCMD_DEBUG=1` and rerun commands to capture verbose logs.
</Step>
<Step title="Consult Further Documentation or Support">
If troubleshooting steps fail, refer to related documentation or seek community support.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Always start troubleshooting by confirming your environment variables, PATH setup, and dependency availability. Early detection of these foundational issues saves time.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Never run MyCmd commands as root or with elevated privileges unless explicitly required, as this may cause permission conflicts or security risks.
</Warning>

<Info>
Enable `MYCMD_DEBUG=1` in your environment to get more detailed output that can help pinpoint issues.
</Info>
