# Feature Summary

## Unlock the Power of Organized Bash Automation

MyCmd delivers a robust framework that brings order, reusability, and efficiency to your Bash scripting workflows. By structuring scripts in hierarchical command groups and integrating essential utilities, MyCmd transforms chaotic script collections into well-maintained command libraries that are easy to navigate and extend.

- Organize your scripts into hierarchical command groups for clear, maintainable structure.
- Launch commands with a consistent, intuitive interface that scales across projects.
- Reuse shell library code seamlessly among commands for DRY automation.
- Access built-in help and version information integrated at every command level.
- Benefit from platform-aware features that adapt across supported operating systems.
- Utilize built-in support utilities for tasks like logging, configuration, and environment management.

**Ideal for:** DevOps engineers, automation developers, power users managing complex Bash workflows.

## What Is This Feature Summary?

This page provides a focused, concise overview of MyCmd's core capabilities. It helps you quickly understand what MyCmd enables you to do without diving into implementation details.

MyCmd addresses the challenges of scripting scalability by introducing hierarchical command groups — directories representing logical command clusters — which allow you to organize scripts and share code efficiently. It also offers a unified command launcher to execute scripts consistently within these groups.

Unlike ad hoc scripts, MyCmd's design encourages modularity, discoverability, and reuse, making your Bash automation workflows more maintainable and productive.

## Core Features & Capabilities

### Hierarchical Command Groups
Organize your commands in nested groups reflecting your project or workflow domains. Each command group carries its own code library, help text, and versioning information.

**Benefits:**
- Easily navigate large script collections.
- Share common setup code via group support libraries.
- Intuitively structure scripts by logical categories.

### Streamlined Command Launching
Use the `mycmd` launcher to execute any command or group of commands using space-separated hierarchical names.

**Example:**
```shell
mycmd financial import chase-visa
```
This runs the `chase-visa` command inside the `import` command group, itself inside the `financial` group.

**Benefits:**
- Consistent CLI across all commands.
- Automatic loading of relevant environment and libraries.

### Shell Library Reuse
Each command group can provide a support library (named with a `-lib` suffix) that commands inherit, enabling reuse of common functions and variables.

**Benefits:**
- Write reusable utilities once.
- Avoid duplication in different commands.
- Improve maintainability and collaboration.

### Integrated Help and Version Information
Every command and command group automatically supports displaying help text and version info.

Invoke help at any level to see descriptions, usage details, and child commands/groups.

```shell
mycmd shell -h
mycmd shell version
```

**Benefits:**
- Always-available documentation for commands.
- Rapid discovery of command capabilities.

### Platform Awareness
MyCmd detects and adapts to supported platforms (Linux, Mac OS), ensuring commands run smoothly and environment differences are managed.

**Benefits:**
- Cross-platform scripting with less manual tweaking.
- Seamless portability across user environments.

### Built-In Support Utilities
MyCmd includes libraries for logging, configuration file handling, event lifecycle management, and output formatting.

**Benefits:**
- Simplify common automation challenges.
- Enhance consistency and debugging capabilities.

## Why Should I Care?

Switching to MyCmd brings measurable improvements to your Bash scripting workflow:

- **Organizational Clarity:** No more scattered scripts; hierarchical command groups provide structure.
- **Efficiency Gains:** Reuse code and avoid rewriting boilerplate.
- **User Experience:** Streamlined command invocation and on-demand help reduce friction.
- **Maintainability:** Shared libraries in command groups ease updates and bug fixes.
- **Portability:** Platform-aware features minimize environment-specific issues.

### Real World Use Cases

- Automating Financial Data Imports with nested command groups per data source.
- Managing Project Automation tasks under a project command group.
- Building a CLI toolkit with multiple reusable Bash commands organized logically.

### Before & After MyCmd

## Getting Started Preview

Starting with MyCmd is straightforward:

- Install MyCmd as per installation instructions.
- Organize your scripts into directories representing command groups.
- Create shell libraries (`-lib` files) inside command groups for reusable code.
- Use `mycmd` to run commands by specifying hierarchical names.

For detailed guidance, visit [Installing MyCmd](../getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/installing-mycmd) and [Your First Command: Creating and Running](../guides/getting-started-with-mycmd/first-command).

<Tip>
Start small by creating a simple command group with one command and experiment with running it via `mycmd`. Gradually add support libraries and nested command groups to scale your automation.
</Tip>
