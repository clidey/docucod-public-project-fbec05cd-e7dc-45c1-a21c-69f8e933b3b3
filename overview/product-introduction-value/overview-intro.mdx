# Product Introduction

## Why Choose MyCmd?

Scripting in Bash can quickly become complex, disorganized, and difficult to maintain, especially as your projects grow. MyCmd transforms your scripting workflow by introducing a clear structure, hierarchy, and effortless code reuse for your command scripts. Imagine having a directory system that not only organizes scripts intuitively but also enables you to build robust command frameworks that scale.

- **Accelerated Workflow:** Quickly access and execute commands through a well-organized hierarchy.
- **Reusable Code:** Share common functions and settings across related commands via command groups.
- **Discoverability:** Easily find and understand available commands and their purpose.
- **Extensibility:** Integrate support libraries that extend functionality within command groups.
- **Traceability:** Access versioning and help information consistently.

This page is designed for developers and sysadmins who want to streamline their Bash scripting with a powerful launcher and management system.

## What Is MyCmd?

MyCmd is a Bash command execution launcher designed to manage scripts with order and clarity. At its core, MyCmd addresses the challenges of unstructured script collections by organizing commands into a hierarchical directory structure known as "command groups." Each command group represents a logical unit of scripts with shared code and metadata.

### The Core of MyCmd:

- **Command Groups:** Directories that contain related commands and other command groups, encapsulating shared code through common shell libraries.
- **Commands:** Individual executable scripts within command groups, accessible through a structured command syntax.
- **Registry:** An internal index that tracks all discovered command groups and commands, enabling fast lookup and execution.

By creating this layered structure, MyCmd empowers you to maintain scalable, modular scripts that grow alongside your projects.

## Key Features & Capabilities

### 1. Hierarchical Command Organization
Commands and command groups are arranged hierarchically in directories, enabling intuitive navigation and execution. This hierarchy allows you to inherit shared functionality in higher-level groups and reduce duplication.

### 2. Metadata Registration and Discovery
MyCmd automatically discovers command groups and commands using a global registry system. This registry stores metadata such as names, versions, descriptions, and help text, streamlining command discovery and usage assistance.

### 3. Support Libraries for Shared Functionality
Each command group can define support libraries—shell scripts suffixed with `-lib`—that automatically load, providing common functions and utilities for commands within the group.

### 4. Simplified Command Execution Flow
From the command line, users invoke MyCmd followed by command groups and commands reflecting the directory paths, abstracting complexity and accelerating execution.

### Example Scenario: Running a Project Task
Suppose you have tasks grouped in `mycmd/project/`, each task implemented as a command script. You can run `mycmd project build` to execute the build process, leveraging shared project libraries and configurations.

## Why Should You Care?

### Streamline Complex Bash Workflows
MyCmd helps you break down complex scripts into manageable, reusable components, cutting down on maintenance time.

### Increase Productivity and Consistency
By standardizing how scripts are structured and accessed, MyCmd prevents fragmentation and promotes consistency across your scripting projects.

### Easy to Adopt and Extend
The directory conventions and naming explicitly tie scripts into the framework, allowing quick onboarding and collaborative development.

## Getting Started Preview

### Quick Start
Getting started involves setting up your environment variables `MYCMD_SYSTEM_BASE_DIR`, `MYCMD_USER_BASE_DIR`, and optionally customizing `MYCMD_SEARCH_PATH` to point to your command directories. Once set, running the `mycmd` command lets you explore available command groups and commands.

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Bash scripting.
- Existing Bash scripts or commands structured in directories following MyCmd conventions.
- Environment variables configured to point MyCmd to your scripts.

### Next Steps
Explore the [Target Audience & Use Cases](/overview/product-introduction-value/target-audience-use-cases) page to understand how MyCmd fits your needs, then dive into the [Feature Summary](/overview/product-introduction-value/feature-overview) for a detailed feature set. Once ready, visit [System Requirements](/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/system-requirements) to set up your environment.
